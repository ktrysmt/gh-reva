// Category — Resolved threads.
//
// A resolved thread (PullRequestReviewThread.isResolved on GitHub) is
// surfaced in two places:
//
//   1. Diff gutter: the anchor glyph swaps from ◆ to ✓. Range markers
//      (┌ start, │ middle) stay unchanged so the range shape stays
//      visible; only the end-anchor flips.
//   2. Comments column: the header carries a leading `[resolved]` tag
//      (line-head position) so the reviewer reads "resolved" before the
//      author name and can skip stale threads at a glance.
//
// Fixture (sample-pr.json):
//   * bob's comment id=1006 on src/greeting.go new line 7 (buffer
//     index 9 in the HEAD patch) is resolved=true.
//   * carol/alice thread (1001 + 1002) on new line 3 (buffer 5)
//     remains unresolved (◆) — the carol/✓ split lets the same
//     screen capture exercise both glyphs.
